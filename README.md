## TDD

This project is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code. Unit tests are written using Jest to cover key functionalities such as user management, authentication, and authorization.

## Built With

- **Node.js** - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **TypeScript** - A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.
- **MySQL** - A relational database management system based on SQL.
- **Sequelize ORM** - A promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL.
- **JWT** - JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication and authorization.

## Tech Stack

**Server:**  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

**Database:**  
- MySQL  

**Testing:**  
- Jest  
- Supertest

## Key Features

- **User Management:** Create, update, delete, and retrieve users with role assignments.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure authentication with JWT and role-based authorization.
- **API Endpoints:** RESTful API endpoints for user and role management.
- **Sequelize ORM:** Efficient database management with Sequelize.
- **TypeScript:** Strongly typed language features for better code quality.
- **TDD:** Comprehensive unit tests for all key functionalities using Jest.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** Version control system.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **npm or yarn:** Package managers.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system.
- **TypeScript:** Static type-checking for JavaScript.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nelofarzabi/User_Management_System.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd user-management-system
    ```

3. **Set up the environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your database configuration and JWT secret.

### Install

Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install or yarn install
```

### Usage
To run the project, execute the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server in development mode. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/api/v1/.

### Run tests
To run tests, execute the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
This will run all unit tests and display the results. You can also check for TypeScript errors by running:
```bash
npm run lint
```
